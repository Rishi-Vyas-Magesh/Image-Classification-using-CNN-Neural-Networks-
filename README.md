# Image-Classification-using-CNN-Neural-Networks-

Using the CIFAR-10 Images dataset available online. I downloaded it, checked its content(by displaying a few images), train_test_split it. I converted the 10 labels to categorical format by One-Hot encoding.
I built "4 DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES" for the CNN model which is a combination of Conv layers, pooling layers,Batch Normalisation and tried techniques like Dropout, L2 regularisation, Early Stopping and plotted the Training and Validation losses to compare the performances and finalised one in the end which worked best.

Later, I found random images from the Internet and tested my model for classification and it worked perfectly!!. All this was done with Python.
I have attached the IPYNB code file to see.
